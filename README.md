# ToogleEngine

Welcome to my second Script.

First off all what does this Script do?
It just simply give you the possibility to turn your Engine from your Vehicle On or Off

#Change the Key in the Configs


#Clean Code

#Every important Code is marked with an information what is does

#Doesnt Need a Serverrestart to start the script

#No SQl File (I hate this xD)

Requirements: pNotify (https://github.com/Nick78111/pNotify)  for the messages but you dont need this when you dont want to use this just change some code in the client.lua but its all marked

Installation: Just download it and Drag in Drop it into your Ressource Folder Add start allrounddrugdealer into your Server.cfg and thats it
